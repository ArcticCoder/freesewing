##### Project board: Our overall todo list

Did you know we have a project board that list all of our issues?
It's a great place to see what we're working on, or what you could help with.

Go to [todo.freesewing.org](https://todo.freesewing.org/) to get there.


##### Updated developer documentation

We've give [freesewing.dev](https://freesewing.dev/), our websites for
developers, a bit of a face-lift to bring it in line with recent changes
on [freesewing.org](https://freesewing.org/), our website for makers.

If you find anything lacking or broken, please don't hesitate
to [create an issue](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/issues/new).
