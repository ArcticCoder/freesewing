  "body": "Effective immediately, all blog and showcase posts on freesewing.org are backed by [our Strapi instance](https://posts.freesewing.org/), rather than [our markdown repository](https://github.com/freesewing/markdown). That markdown repository has been archived, and the markdown content that are not blog or showcase posts  (predominantly documentation) has been moved into [our monorepo](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing).\n\n## These changes have already been deployed\n\nBoth freesewing.org and freesewing.dev have been updated to reflect this new reality. That includes pulling blog and showcase posts from strapi, but we also replaced the markdown submodule with our monorepo to access the markdown content.\n\n## Impact on translation\n\nThis change also has an impact on translations, as we used to have two crowdin projects, one for the markdown content (linked to the markdown repository) and another for the strings (linked to our monorepo). \n\nNow that all this content in hosted in our monorepo, I have merged these projects, so that we now have a single Crowdin project that's available via [translate.freesewing.org](https://translate.freesewing.org/).\n\nWhile that consolidates translation on Crowdin, we now have a different split since content hosted on Strapi must be translated there. However, translation of blog posts and showcase posts is a lot less crucial than translation of the documentation and strings.\n\nIn addition, this also opens the door for having original non-English content. For example, a French blog post could be written that does not need to be available in English. This is a departure of the tight coupling of English (as the origin language) and the translations for this kind of language, and opens the door for the various linguistic communities to make our blogs more *their own* by providing original content.\n\n## Impact on content creation\n\nPeople looking to create blog posts or showcases should now use Strapi to do so.\nThe [documentation for editors](https://freesewing.dev/editors/howtos/) has already been updated.\n\nIf you want a Strapi account, please let us know [on our Discord server](https://discord.freesewing.org)\n\n## Thanks, I hate it\n\nThese are the first changes to come out of [project 2022](/blog/project-2022) and they impact the way contributors & translators work, which is potentially frustrating to people.\n\nApart from doing my work on project 2022 in the open, I've also tried to create some buy-in by adding a discussion on these changes to the [agenda of the contributor call of 3 weeks ago](https://github.com/freesewing/freesewing/issues/1241). \n\nAs that agenda item was not picked up, it is possible that people feel blind-sighted by these changes. If that is the case, feel free to reach out to me to discuss where I'm going with this.",
