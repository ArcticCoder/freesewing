  "body": "Yesterday, I merged our markdown content into our monorepo, and archived our markdown repository. Our documentation now lives side-by-side with our code, and that opens up some options that previously would have been cumbersome to implement. \n\nToday, I went ahead and added auto-generated images to the documentation page for all pattern options. The idea is simple: For each option, we [sample the option](https://freesewing.dev/reference/api/pattern/sampleoption/) which generates an SVG image like the one below:\n\n![aaron_chestease_sample.svg](https://posts.freesewing.org/uploads/aaron_chestease_sample_5600e96385.svg)\n\nWe currently have 761 pattern options, so after generating the image, I went ahead and added it at the bottom of each of the documentation pages.\n\n## No more shared option pages\n\nTo make this possible, I first had to de-dupe a bunch of documentation pages that were shared between various patterns. Patterns that extend another pattern often share a bunch of options, and initially I added logic to the frontend code to avoid having to create all this documenation.\n\nHowever, this added logic makes it harder for people to wrap their head around our frontend, and understand how things work (where is this documentation coming from?). It also meant that sometimes the description of the option was poorly matched to the pattern. For example, the documentation would talk about a *block* because the option documentation is re-used from Brian, when the user is browsing documentation for a different design that happens to extend Brian and use this option.\n\nI had to add a bunch of new markdown files and folders for this, but it will make organisation of the documentation more straight-forward, and in general simpler to *get* how the website works, which was a goal I set for myself in [project 2022](/blog/project-2022).\n\nAnd while in principle this would add a bunch of translation work, these are all strings that have been translated before, so I triggered an automatic translation based on the so-called *translation memory* in Crowdin. (This translation memory is a list of strings and their translations that have been translated and approved inside the project).\n\nIf you see some pattern options where this doesn't work, or looks weird, [let me know](https://discord.freesewing.org/).\n",
