So no extra Javascript to ship ðŸŽ‰\n\n## Can I haz themes?\n\nAnother thing that DaisyUI brings to the table is support for themeing. While TailwindCSS recently added support for dark mode, theming in DaisyUI is more flexible, allowing us to not only have dark and light versions of the site, but also a bunch of other themes.\n\nFor someone who gets bored easily like myself, that sounds great  ðŸ˜ƒ\n",
