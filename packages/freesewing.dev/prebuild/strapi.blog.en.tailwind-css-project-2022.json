But you need an ocean of discipline (or perhaps a good design system) to make sure things are consistent.\n\nFor a while now, there's a new kid on the block that promises to help with taming this CSS mess: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).\n\nThere's a lot of people who love it, there's some haters too. I kicked the tires a bit and once you get used to the declarative approach, I find it to be rather pleasant to work with.\n\nSo, I am going to use Tailwind to handle the style for [project 2022](/blog/project-2022). I am hopeful that this will also lower the barrier for contributors to go ahead and make things pretty. Because things can always be prettier.",
