While FreeSewing supports millimeter options, we recommend
using [percentage options][1] and will not accept
contributions that use millimeter options.

## Structure

A millimeter option should be a plain object with these properties:

-   `mm` : The default value in millimeter
-   `min` : The minimul that's allowed
-   `max` : The maximum that's allowed
-   `hide` <small>(optional)</small> : A method to [control the optional display of the option][hide]

## Example

```js
options: {
  elasticWidth: { 
    mm:  35, 
    min:  5, 
    max: 80 
  }
}
```

##### What's wrong with millimeter options?

Millimeter options do not scale.
Parametric design is the *raison d'Ãªtre* of FreeSewing and that core belief
that things should seamlessly adapt goes out the window when you use a `mm`
option because now you have a value that will not change based on the
input measurements.

You could argue that it's fine because *you can just lower the option*
but that breaks the principle of *sensible defaults* (aka no surprises).
The fact that you can sidestep the bullet does not mean you're not creating
a footgun.

When you need a millimeter option, reach for a [snapped
percentage option][1] instead.
