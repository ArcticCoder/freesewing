title: Pattern.apply()
---

A pattern's `apply()` method merges the settings passed to it with 
the current pattern settings. It is used internally to merge the 
settings that are passed to the pattern constructor with the default settings.

<Note>This method is chainable as it returns the Pattern object</Note>

## Pattern.apply() signature

```js
Pattern pattern.apply(object settings)
``` 

<Note>
You are unlikely to ever user this method directly.
