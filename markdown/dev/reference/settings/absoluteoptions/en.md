title: absoluteOptions
---

The `absoluteOptions` setting holds the values for snapped percentage options.

<Tip>

The `absoluteOptions` setting is not intended to be set directly.
Instead, using _snapped percentage options_ will automatically cause
the option values to be generated.
You can access these values through the destructured `absoluteOptions`
property.

Please see the
[snapped percentage options reference](/reference/api/part/config/options/pct/snap)
for more details.
