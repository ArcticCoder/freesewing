title: Curated measurements sets
---

FreeSewing's **curated measurements sets** are a collection of
measurements sets that represent actual real people.

They are used by designers to test their designs on a variety of bodies, as
well as by FreeSewing users to test the platform.

## History

FreeSewing has always been a platform for made-to-measure sewing patterns, so a
range of *standard sizes* has never been in our wheelhouse.

However, having to take measurements prior to even being able to try the
platform adds a lot of friction to the onboarding of new users.  So at one
point, we added a sizing table with a variety of measurements/sizes.

Those where based on 2 actualy people, one cismale and one cisfemale, and then
graded up and down to generate the various *sizes*.

This sizing table had of course many issues with it, especially when you
ventured further from the base model, but it was enough to kick the tires and
to test our designs.

While the sizing does cover a hefty range of sizes, they are all more or less
the same type of body, as they are graded up and down from the same person.  We
started seeing fitting issues with other types of bodies, children or people
who have different proporties or carry their weight in other ways.

With the release of version 3 of FreeSewing, we wanted to move away from these
*made up* measurements and instead work with the data of real people to test
our platform. And, as a side effect, we would also no longer present users who
want to try out the site a range of *standard sizes* but rather a collection of
measurements sets where they can pick the one that best represents their own
body.

## Suggesting a measurements set for curation

We rely on our community to submit measurements sets for curation. 
If you have a public measurements set on the site, you can suggest it for curation.

To be part of our curated measurments sets collection, you should provide the following:

- All measurements of the person. We do not accept incomplete sets as that would mean some designs would not work with them.
- The height of the person. This helps users select a measurements set closest to their own body.
- A picture of the person. See below for tips.


## Tips for subimtting your measurements set for curation

Below are some tips for those considering suggesting their measurements set for curation.

### Don't stand too close to the camera

When you have all your measurements added, along with your height,
there is only one thing left to do: Take a picture.

We present measurements sets in a line-up style, so the picture should be a
full frontal picture where you are standing straight and relaxed with your arms
beside your body. 

For best results, ask a friend to take a picture from further away and zoom in.
This helps avoid the *fisheye* effect that you get when taking a picture from up close.

#### A picture taken from (too) close

There's nothing really wrong with this picture, but it looks weird. 
That's because this is taken with a mobile phone and the wide angle on these types of cameras gives you this subtle fish eye effect.

#### A picture taken from further away with zoom

This picture on the other hard was taken from further away with the zoom.
This is a much better representation of reality and the pose looks natural because the fish eye effect is neutralized.

<Tip>

Please strive to provide a picture like the second example for your curated measurements set.

#### Stand in front of a white background

We will edit out the background of your picture like this:

So you can make that step a lit easier for us if you can pose in front of a white or plain background.
