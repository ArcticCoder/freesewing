title: '¿Por qué te molestas en publicar corpiños de mujer? Son [insertar convicción fuerte aquí].'
---

Esta pregunta aparece de vez en cuando. Las palabras cambian, pero la idea se puede resumir como *por qué molestarse en publicar esta basura, no funciona*.

Os digo, algo de razón hay. Tanto [Breanna](/designs/breanna/) como [Bella](/designs/bella/) tienen defectos importantes.

Yo mismo ([joost](/makers/joostdecock/)) soy muy consciente, y le he dado vueltas a la idea de retractarme de estos patrones por completo.

Pero hay un subconjunto de gente que consigue buenos resultados con ellos. I've seen several good looking makes based on Bella, and Breanna seems to be popular with people making doll clothes for some reason.

What I'm saying is, we're not removing them because they work in some cases. Not in all cases though, which can be frustrating.

I don't pretend to know how to draft for women. But I do get questions all the time about adding more womenswear to freesewing.org, and that starts with a well-designed block.

I have long waited for somebody to step forward to take this on themselves. Alas, I've been waiting in vain. Since the fastest way to get a question answered on the internet is to answer it yourself incorrectly, I set out to create these blocks.

So if you think you can do better, I hereby formally invite you to work together to design the womenswear block that you think/know to be the best one out there.

I gladly offer my services to code/implement your design/vision, so that the entire sewing community can benefit from it.

You can reach me at joost at freesewing.org, we also have [an active community on Discord](https://discord.freesewing.org/).

I hope to hear from you soon.

joost
