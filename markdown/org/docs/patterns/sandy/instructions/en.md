<Warning>

Due to the different styles and configurations of Sandy you may find you need to skip or re-order certain steps.
We're not going to go into a full explanation on how to create all the individual details 
that make up a circke skirt. These instructions assume that you know how to sew a zipper, construct pockets, etc. If not, there are numerous excellent articles available on the web, both in writen form, and on video. If you do get stuck, you can always reach out to [other FreeSewers](https://discord.freesewing.org/) in our discord.

</Warning>

<Note>

Due to seamless and closure Sandy's needing different constructions we will separate the instructions.

</Note>

## Sandy with Closure (default)

### Step 1: Prepping the Skirt

- With _good sides together_ sew the skirt seam up to where you intend the opening to start.
- Add Pockets if using.
- If using lining, prep the same as the skirt
- Insert zipper or placket into opening if using.

## Sandy with no closure (seamless)

### Step 1: Lining and Skirt

- Gather skirt and lining skit if needed.
- Face skirt if desired.
- Attach Lining to skirt at hem by your preferred method if using.
- *Baste* Lining to skirt at waist.

<Note>

These instructions will treat the lining and skirt the same at the waist.

</Note>

### Step 2: The waistband

- With *good sides together* sew the waistband in half along the short seams, leaving a gap for the elastic that will be on the inside.
- Press under the seam allowance on the long edge of the waistband that is intended to be on the inside.
- With *good sides together* attach the waistband to the skirt along the unpressed seam. Trim seam.
- Press waistband up away from skirt over seam allowance.
- Press the waistband to the inside along the fold-line.
- *Edgestitch* the waistband in place.
- Alternatively you can *Slipstitch* or *Whipstitch* the waistband in place on the inside.
- Cut the elastic to your waist.
- Thread the elastic through the opening of the waistband making sure not to lose the end.
- Overlap the ends by 1cm (3/8 inch) and stitch in place.
- Tuck elastic into waistband and close the opening with hand-sewing.
- Hem the skirt if you have not already done so with the lining.

<Tip>

If you are having keeping the pressed under seam allowance of the waistband folded/not staying pressed you may find it helpful to _Baste_ this seam in place.

### Step 3: Enjoy!

You all done! Now go enjoy your wonderfully seamless skirt!
