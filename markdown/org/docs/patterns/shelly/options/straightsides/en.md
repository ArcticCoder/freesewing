title: "Straight sides"
---

Forms a tubular shirt, which is a shirt where the hips and chests are the same width and connected by a straight seam. Set this to true for a bodice that is perfectly rectangular below the armholes. This setting overrides any values set for the hips or body shape. For most body types, leaving this option on will result in a reasonable fit that is looser around the belly and tighter around the chest, and generally produces a more fabric-efficient pattern.
