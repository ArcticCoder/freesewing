
To make Carlton, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 5 - 6 metres of a suitable main fabric ([see Carlton Fabric options](/docs/patterns/carlton/fabric/))
- About 3.5 - 4 metres of lining fabric ([see Carlton Fabric options](/docs/patterns/carlton/fabric/))
- About 0.75 - 1 metre of sleeve lining fabric ([see Carlton Fabric options](/docs/patterns/carlton/fabric/))
- Light to Mediumweight hair canvas ([see Carlton Fabric options](/docs/patterns/carlton/fabric/))
- Heavyweight hair canvas ([see Carlton Fabric options](/docs/patterns/carlton/fabric/))
- Tailors tape
- 6 Buttons for front closure
- Strong thread for attaching facings
- (Optional) Silk buttonhole twist if hand-sewing the buttonholes and buttons.
