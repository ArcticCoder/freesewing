## Step 1: The Body

### The Face

- __Octoplushy__
  - With _good sides together_ sew four head parts together, from notch B to the tip of the head part A creating a semi-sphere like shape.
  - Repeat with the remaining four to create a second half.
  - Use topstitching, or a long bar-tack, to make the mouth on one of the segments.
  - On the same section create eyes where the buttons are marked on the pattern.
  - With _good sides together_ sew the two head halfs together, from notch B to the tip of the head part A.
  - Turn *good sides* out.

<Note>

There are a couple of ways to make eyes for the Octoplushy version.
  - Buttons
  - Toy eyes
  - Embroidery
  - Felt or other suitable unravelling fabrics which can be combined with a _satin stitch_

</Note>

- __Octopus__
  - With _good sides together_ sew four head parts together, from notch B to the tip of the head part A creating a semi-sphere like shape.
  - Repeat with the remaining four to create a second half.
  - With _wrong sides_ to _good sides_ sew the pupil to eyes parts. 
  - With _good sides together_ sew both short ends of eyebrows together, creating a ring. 
  - With _good sides together_ sew the eyebrows to the circumferences of the eyes, gathering the excess as you go.
  - Fold the eyebrows in half *wrong sides together*, and sew it again to the eyes. You may find it easier to hand sew this step.  
  - Hand sew the eyes to the lower part of one of the head halfs, so that you will have two sections between them when it all comes together.
  - With _good sides together_ sew the two head halfs together, from notch B to the tip of the head part A.
  - Turn *good sides* out.

<Note>

Before sewing the eyebrows in half, you can stuff the eyebrows to create a more dramatic looking eyebrow.

- __Squid__
  - With _good sides together_ sew four head parts together, from notch B to the tip of the head part A creating a semi-sphere like shape.
  - Repeat with the remaining four to create a second half.
  - On the head (a) parts fold along the fold-line with *good sides together*.
  - Sew the straight line that juts out and then turn the flap *good sides* out. 
  - With *good sides together* sew the non - flap edges of the head (a) parts to the one of the head halfs sewn earlier, from notch B to the tip of the head part A.
  - With *wrong side* to *good side* sew the pupils to the eyes and finish their sides the best you can.
  - Hand Sew the eyes to the section closest to the legs.
  - With _good sides together_ sew the two halfs together, from notch B to the tip of the head part A making sure that the flaps are on the outside.
  - Turn *good sides* out.

## Step 2: The Legs

- Sew 4 parts 2 together, from D to C. 
  - For Squid: Sew one part 5 to each, from D to C. 

- Sew both leg parts together, but only along one seam from D to C. The other stays open to fill the plushy.

- Match up the leg parts with the body parts. Sew each leg from B/D to B/D. It is easiest to sew one leg almost to the next B/D part, stop sewing, pin the next leg, and start sewing again. The bottom part (2,5) is slightly shorter than the top part of a leg, so you have to ease it in while matching it up.

## Step 3: Finishing up

- Stuff the plushy through the opening in the legs.
- Hand sew the remaining seam.

## Step 4: Enjoy!

- That's it you are all done now go explore the depths of the oceans with your new Octoplushy!
