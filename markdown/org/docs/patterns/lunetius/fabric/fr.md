Lunetius can be made out of almost any woven fabric. Historically "accurate" would be linen, wool, and, to an extent, cotton. If you care about authenticity, research this a bit. In any case, natural fibers without any stretch are the way to go.

Depending on the social status you want to portray, choose coarser or finer fabrics. Different colours are also possible.

Since one of the reasons of wearing a cloak is to be protected from the elements, take the weather and temperature into account when choosing your fabric. What are you planning to do with your lacerna? You will need different fabrics for, let's say, taking a hike in the woods while it's raining in cold weather in a LARP-session, or showing up in a cloak for a costume party in summer. Even if you don't care about being *actually* protected from the weather, the weight of your chosen fabric will affect the drape and look. From my experience, slightly heavier fabrics will give you better looking results, adding a bit more *gravitas* to your cloak.
