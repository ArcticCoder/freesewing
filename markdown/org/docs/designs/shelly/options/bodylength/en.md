title: "Body length"
---

Controls how long the shirt is.
   - Up to 80% or so will produce a crop top.
   - 100% ends at the waistband of most pants, with no overlap.
   - 120% will produce a typical t-shirt.
   - 140% will produce a somewhat longer shirt that is less prone to untucking or riding up.
   - 200%+ can be used to make a simple t-shirt dress. It's suggested that you set straight sides to false, and adjust the side shape (under advanced options) for t-shirt dresses.
