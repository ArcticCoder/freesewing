![The armpit ease option on Onyx](armpitease.svg)

Shifts the sleeves downward to give extra room in the armpit, measured as a percentage of the sleeve diameter. If in doubt, go with the default value.

Note: This option does not change the diameter of the sleeve. To make the sleeve larger or smaller, use the Sleeve ease option.

Note: The Raglan scoop length and Raglan scoop depth options also affect the amount of ease in the armpit.
