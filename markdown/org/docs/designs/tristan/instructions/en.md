<Note>
##### There are many ways to sew a Tristan
These instructions are for a lined Tristan top with a center-front lacing closure and bias binding at the neckline, armhole, and hem.
</Note>

### Step 1: Cut your pieces

Cut your pattern pieces. If you would like to add embroidery or other decoration, now is a good time to do so.

### Step 2: Sew the back inside (Part 3) parts together at center back

Align the back inside (Part 3) parts at center back. Sew them together with _good sides together_.

### Step 3: Attach back outside (Part 4) parts

Attach one back outside (Part 4) part to its matching back inside (Part 3) part, _good sides together_, making sure to match any notches.

Do the same for the other back outside (Part 4) part.

### Step 4: Attach front outside (Part 2) parts at the side seams

Attach one front outside (Part 2) part to its matching back outside (Part 3) part, _good sides together_.

Do the same for the other front outside (Part 2) part.

### Step 5: Attach front inside (Part 1) parts

Finally, attach one front inside (Part 1) part to its matching front inside (Part 2) part, _good sides together_.

Do the same for the other front inside (Part 1) part.

Press all the seam allowances flat.

### Step 6: Stitch at the shoulders

Stitch at the shoulders. Press.

<Note>
##### Check the fit
This is a good time to try on your garment and make any small adjustments. For example, if your shoulders have a different slope, you could make one shoulder strap a little shorter.
</Note>

### Step 7: Repeat with lining fabric

Repeat Steps 1 through 6 with your lining fabric.

You will now have two identical pieces, one with your main fabric and one with your lining.

### Step 8: Begin the closure by stitching down center front

Place the center insides of the main and lining together, _good sides together_.

Stitch down center front.

Turn right side out and press.

### Step 9: Topstitch the center front

Stitch 2 mm (0.1 inch) in from center edge.

Repeat on the other side.

<Note>
##### Switching sides for each step is optional
These instructions suggest doing each step on each side to keep the stitching lines even and symmetrical, but itâ€™s fine to do all the closure steps on one side then move on the other if you prefer.
</Note>

### Step 10: Stitch your first boning channel

Allow enough space for your boning, then stitch again.

Repeat on the other side.

<Note>
##### Leave enough room for your boning
Leave enough wiggle room to allow you to insert your boning. You want the channel to be snug, but not too tight.
</Note>

### Step 11: Stitch your eyelet channel

Mark the locations of your eyelets/grommets. Allow enough space to install these later, then stitch again.

Repeat on the other side.

### Step 12: Stitch your second boning channel

Allow enough space for another row of boning, then stitch again.

Repeat on the other side.

### Step 13: Insert your boning

Cap your boning if appropriate for the type of boning used.

### Step 14: Bind your top

Apply bias binding to the neck hole, armholes, and hem.
