<Note>

This is a garment made from a stretch fabric. So use appropriate seam solutions. A serger is a good way to do this, as 
are specific stitches that certain sewing machine provide. A zigzag stitch will do if that's all you have.

Keep in mind that since these seams are always under tension, it may be a good idea to double them up, or 
provide a zigzag in addition to serging the seam.

### Step 1: The legs

- Sew each leg along the long seam to itself. This will result in two 'pipes' of your fabric

### Step 2: Combine

- Sew the two pieces together along the back seam. This seam is marked with '+'.

### Step 3: Gusset preparation

- If you have a front bulge in your gusset, sew the middle 'dart' closed first.
- If you do not have a front bulge, it is useful to sew the front seam closed. This seam is marked with '-'.

### Step 4: Gusset 

- Match all the notches of the gusset with the legs and seams. Be careful, since you'll be sewing a circle 
to an outline, and that is always tricky to get right. Use a lot of pins, or clips, to keep the fabrics
aligned. 
- Sew the seam from one side all the way to the other.

### Step 5: Attaching the waistband

- If you have selected the waistband option, sew the waistband into a circle.
- Align this seam with the seam in the back.
- Sew all the way around, attaching the waistband to the legs.

### Step 6: Finish up

Now you can add the elastic to the leg openings and waistband if you so prefer. Otherwise finish those
in any way you like.


You're all done! Enjoy your Lumina leggings!
