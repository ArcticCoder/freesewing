## Step 1: The eyes

- Sew the eyes into cones by sewing the Sew-Together side together

## Step 2: The Nose

- Do the same with the nose, now doing it twice. You'll end up with two cones joined together

## Step 3: The darts

- Close all the darts and remove extra fabric. 

## Step 4: The rest

- All seams have been numbered. It's best to start at seam 1 and work your way through them. Leave an opening in seam 21 to stuff Skully.

## Step 5: Hair

- Now is the time to add hair. Add as much or as little as you like. It's a good idea to put knots in the strands as you sew them, for otherwise it's easy to pull them out.

## Step 6: Stuffing

- Fill the plush toy with stuffing through the opening you left in seam 21.
- _Slipsticth_ or _whipstitch_ the opening closed.

## Step 7: Tweaks

- Once you have Skully sewn and filled, you can use a long needle to sew the back of the eyes and nose to seam 21. This will keep them from inverting, and can shape the toy better. 
- With the same long needle, make stitches from seam 6 to 14, shaping the cheeks more.

## Step 8: Enjoy!

That's it you are all done!
