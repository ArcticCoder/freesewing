title: "Skully: Fabric Options"
---

## Main Fabric

This plush toy is best constructed with a felt type fabric. The thickness and limited stretch of a felt fabric allow the plush toy to better create the shape of skully.

## Hair

Skully is supposed to have hair. Embroidery floss is well suited for this. 

## Stuffing

Since this is a plush toy, it will need to be stuffed with material. Most of the time you'll want to use polyester fiberfill (polyfill), but if you have a lot of fabric scraps, you can use shredded scrap fabric. However this may be heavier and less soft than fiberfill. It's also worth thinking about whether your Hi may be at risk of getting dirty, or want to go for a swim, as not all stuffing options are washable.
