title: "Naomi Wu Cargo Skirt: Fabric Options"
---

A cargo skirt is work wear, so you want to go with fabric that can stand the
wear and tear of screwdrivers being wiped clean on them, nuts and bolts
rattling around in its pockets.

While there's plenty of choice in synthetic fibers, I would recommend a heavy-weight cotton or canvas.  You also can't go wrong with what has been the de-facto standard for heavy duty workwear for many years: denim.

However, avoid any hint of stretchy fibers. You want zero stretch. This baby should not start sagging as you load it with cargo.
