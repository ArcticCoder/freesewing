title: "Front attachment chamfer size"
---

This option controls the chamfer size at the bottom of the front attachment.

The front attachment is like a pocket that is only attached at the waist. It is a common feature on workwear as it allows greater mobility. An attachment like this exists because it's not so easy to bend over when there's a big wrench in your pocket.

An attachment with chamfered corners at the bottom help to avoid small items getting lost in the corners of your pockets.

<Note>

A [chamfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamfer) is a term borrowed from the machining world to describe the process of softening a sharp 90° angle into two consecutive 45° angles.
