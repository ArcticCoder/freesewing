title: Back attachment width
---

This option controls the width of the back attachment.

The back attachment is like a pocket that is only attached at the waist. It is a common feature on workwear as it allows greater mobility.
An attachment like this exists because it's not so easy to bend over when there's a big wrench in your pocket.

If the back attachment gets too wide to fit between the belt loops, the pattern will warn you about this as it complicates construction.
