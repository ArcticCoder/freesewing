title: Waist slant
---

This option will draft a cargo skirt where the waist is slanted upwards towards the back.

By default, the waist is perfectly straight, which is fine for people built like Naomi (which means, very skinny).
If you have more curves, you will almost certainly find that you need a bit more rise in the back, and this option can provide that.
