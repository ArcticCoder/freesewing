title: Front attachment width
---

This option controls the width of the front attachment.

The front attachment is like a pocket that is only attached at the waist. It is a common feature on workwear as it allows greater mobility.
An attachment like this exists because it's not so easy to bend over when there's a big wrench in your pocket.
