title: "Naomi Wu Cargo Skirt: Designer Notes"
---

This design implements Naomi Wu's cargo skirt. It is based on Naomi's actual skirt that she shipped to me to reproduce. That skirt was in turn a based on a pair of workwear trousers that were hacked into a skirt.

As such, it's essentially the top of what you would expect from workwear pants, but in skirt form.

##### Naomi Who?

[Naomi Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Wu), also known by her online pseudonym *SexyCyborg* is a Chinese tech & DIY girl from Shenzhen, China.
She is known for her signature style blending DIY, electronics, and fashion, and has proven to be a
relentless advocate for women in STEM and LGBTQ rights.

Despite all prejudice and setbacks due to her gender expression, she managed to grow a large online audience, become a minor celebrity in the 3D-printers community, and at one point single-handedly compelled Chinese companies to take GPL-violations serious. As further testament to her status as a famous maker, she graced the cover of Make magazine in 2018.

As an outspoken Chinese citizen  with a tendency for telling it like it is, and a large international following, Noami drew the heat, and in the summer of 2023 the Chinese government de-facto silenced her. Ever since, her [Twitter](https://twitter.com/realsexycyborg) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reallysexycyborg/) accounts, and [YouTube channel](
www.youtube.com/c/SexyCyborg) have fallen silent. Although [her online shop remains available](https://cybernightmarket.com/).
