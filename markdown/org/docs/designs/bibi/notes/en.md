title: "Bibi: Designer Notes"

When I was designing Tina, I originally considered basing the pattern on 
Brian. However, Tina is supposed to work for people with breasts
and Brian is mostly designed for menswear and doesn't support much body
and bust fitting.

For this design, I reused code from Brian mostly for the sleevecap and armhole construction 
and added a basic front bust adjustment.

Because Bibi is supposed to be usable for very different lengths, I
also changed the sideline calculation to fit to the waist and seat measurements
and I added a sleeveless option and this is basically the result.
